This is a fun Discord bot built in Python and can be invited to any server where it shows you memes when summoned😋. 

✨ Features

~ Uses the Discord Developer Portal for bot setup, permissions, and authentication.

~ Built using the discord.py library (installed via pip).

~ Uses existing Discord admin roles and permissions, so only authorized users can manage it.

~ Responds to user messages inside the server.

~ Pulls memes from open-source Reddit content.
